      <h1>Time Keeps on Slippin'</h1>
      <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Kif might! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
      <h2>A Clone of My Own</h2>
      <p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? And until then, I can never die? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Shut up and get to the point! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
      <ul>
      <li>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money.</li>
      <li>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</li>
      <li>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Anthology of Interest II</h3>
      <p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
      <h4>A Bicyclops Built For Two</h4>
      <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Okay, I like a challenge. I wish! It's a nickel. Noooooo!</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</li>
      <li>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</li>
      <li>No, she'll probably make me do it.</li>
      <li>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>The Why of Fry</h5>
      <p>We're rescuing ya. Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p>
